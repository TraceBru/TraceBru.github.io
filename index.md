## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* lab 7

    I enjoyed the learning process of this lab along with the learning curve of dealing with many variables and assigning them to the properly to ensure of the proper output. This lab helped me simplify managing  through many functions and understand how to effectively use them in tandem. The output of calculating the which parking sign I would be able to park near was interesting to see and cool to test the different outputs. 

* lab 6

    The initial idea of this lab was exciting alone as I have played blackjack games as a kid and I was eager to attempt to create my own project utitlizing a game I recognized. It seemed like a tough lab at first but quickly taught me how to effectively use Boolean variables in larger scale with many different values assigned. Using Boolean's in this manner opened my eyes to the different uses they can have and how effective they can be in efficiency. 

* lab10

    Working with files was something I have been looking forward to and the implimentation was incredibly satisfying to see properly execute. Using different iostream files in this lab showed me how useful stoi conversions are and how broadly it can be used. Checking to make sure a file has been read was very interesting to learn as I never realized how common it is checked.
